Welcome to our web application, Agile Team 16 Echo! Below are the steps to get the application running on your local machine:

**Prerequisites:**
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (We recommend the latest LTS version)
- npm (Node Package Manager, which comes with Node.js)
- A text editor or IDE for code editing (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)
- Git (optional, for version control)

If you have received this application as a zip file, skip to the next step. Otherwise, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaVamsi72/SSW-555-Echo.git
```

If you've extracted the zip file, navigate to the extracted folder in your terminal or command prompt.

**Install Dependencies:**
In the root directory of the project, run the following command to install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

**Running the Application:**
To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the server. By default, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000. If you have configured a different port, use that instead.

**Additional Information:**
- Public Assets: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are located in the public directory.
- Application Routes: The application's URL structure is handled in the routes directory. Review these files to understand the routes.
- Views: Dynamic HTML templates are located in the views directory.
