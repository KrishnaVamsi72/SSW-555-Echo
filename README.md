**Getting Started with Our Web Application**
Welcome to our web application! This guide will walk you through the steps needed to get the application up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
A text editor or IDE of your choice for code editing (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)
Git (optional, for version control)
**Installation**

**Clone the Repository :** If you've received this application as a zip file, skip this step. Otherwise, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaVamsi72/SSW-555-Echo.git


**Navigate to the Application Directory:**
If you've extracted the zip file, navigate to the extracted folder (new test) in your terminal or command prompt.
Install Dependencies: Run the following command in the root directory of the project to install the required npm packages:
Copy code
npm install


**Configuration**
Environment Variables: Check the config directory and ensure you have the necessary configuration files. If config.zip contains additional configurations, extract them into the config directory.
DataBase Setup: If the application uses a database, refer to the data directory for initial data and use seed.js to seed your database:

node seed.js


Running the Application
To start the application, run:


npm start
This command will start the server. By default, the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 unless configured differently in the application settings.

Additional Information
Public Assets: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are located in the public directory.
Application Routes: Application routing is handled in the routes directory. Review these files to understand the application's URL structure.
Views: Dynamic HTML templates are located in the views directory.
