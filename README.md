These instructions will guide you through setting up the application on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

npm install (install required libraries)

npm start  (to run the application)

create another folder with the python file app.py and model.pth and run by the command python app.py to facilitate real time prediction
